This document describes the latest changes, additions, known issues, and fixes
for Docker Enterprise Edition (Docker EE).

Docker EE builds upon the corresponding Docker CE that it
references. Docker EE also includes back-ported fixes (security-related
and priority defects) from the open source as well as enterprise
features. It incorporates defect fixes that you can use in environments
where new features cannot be adopted as quickly for consistency and
compatibility reasons.

# Changelog
